This is Eric Johnsons assembler program for Architecture and Assembly project 6

The main driver file is main.c

To run program:

make
main [FILENAME LOCATION HERE]
(ex: main pong/Pong.asm)

then, use assembler tool to load in the original asm file, and the new .hack file to compare it to to confirm its correctness.
